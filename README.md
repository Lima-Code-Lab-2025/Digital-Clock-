🔧 How It Works

This project is built using standard web technologies:

HTML lays out the clock and toggle button structure — simple and semantic.

CSS styles the clock with glowing green matrix effects and handles smooth transitions between light and dark themes.

JavaScript runs the clock logic, updates the time every second, toggles themes on button click, and uses the Web Speech API to play voice feedback when switching modes.
